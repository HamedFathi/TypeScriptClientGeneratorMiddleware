For a long time, I was looking for finding a way to connect Back-end and Front-end teams together when they are working on same APIs and time ti time update them.

In this use case, Back-end team provide bunch of APIs then Front-end team should follow them to call APIs correctly but how possible to get correct info from back-end side correctly or update front-end client after some changes?

One good solution is using `Open API or Swagger` as a source of truth but you don't have access to client definitions like TypeScript interfaces, Is it possible to make the process a bit easier?

Recently, I made an ASP.NET Core middleware based on [NSwag TypeScriptClientGenerator](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag/wiki/TypeScriptClientGenerator).

## Installation


## Usage

```cs
// SERVICES
builder.Services.AddTypeScriptClientGenerator(options =>
{
    options.Options = new List<TypeScriptClientGeneratorOption>
    {
        // You can set array of endpoints.
        new()
        {
            // The URI you want to see the generated result and share it.
            Endpoint = "my_ts_client",  
            // Absolute URI of Swagger/Open API JSON file.
            SwaggerJsonEndpoint = "https://localhost:7031/swagger/v1/swagger.json", 
            // You can pass your own source code processor to customize final result, If don't you will get full source code which is generated by NSwag.
            // ExtractInterfacesAndEnums is a method provided by the library to extract just interfaces and enums to share with others.
            Process = GeneratedSourceProcessor.ExtractInterfacesAndEnums 
        },
        new()
        {
            Endpoint = "petstore_ts_client",
            SwaggerJsonEndpoint = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/main/examples/v3.0/petstore.json",
            Process = GeneratedSourceProcessor.ExtractInterfacesAndEnums
        }
    };
});

// APP
app.UseTypeScriptClientGenerator();
```
